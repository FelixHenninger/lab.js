Managing studies with Open Lab
==============================

`Open Lab`_ is a web application that makes study hosting easy and provides a secure foundation for data collection.
Open Lab has a direct integration with lab.js that offers a fast and transparent way to deploy your study.
The purpose of Open Lab is not to design an experiment, but to deploy it online in the most efficient way, focusing on data security, performance and user experience.
