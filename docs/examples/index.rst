Examples & recipes
==================

.. note::
  **This documentation page is currently under development. Sorry for that!**

  We're actively working on this, so please check back in a bit. Also, please
  be invited to send us a line or two, we've probably got at half-baked working
  version that we can share, or we can help you get started directly.

  Sorry for the trouble!
  
The current directory of examples studies is hosted 
`in a repository <https://github.com/FelixHenninger/lab.js/tree/master/examples>`__
and available from within the builder interface.

Contributions are very welcome!
