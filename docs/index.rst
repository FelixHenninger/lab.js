Welcome to the **lab.js** documentation!
========================================

About
-----
**lab.js is a toolkit of blocks for constructing client-side online experiments
in Javascript.** Its goal is to provide an intuitive and approachable means of
proramming experiments for researchers familiar with ``HTML`` and ``CSS``,
but only limited experience with Javascript. At the same time, it aims to
remain flexible and extensible, so as not to restrict advanced users.

Initially built for experimental psychology, it can be used to construct
experiments throughout the social and behavioral sciences. It is not limited
to any particular paradigm or environment, and designed to handle questionnaires
just as well as complex experimental tasks.

An additional design goal is to provide a tool for :ref:`teaching` programming
and experimental design to students. In particular, it is intended to provide
a stepping stone for students with knowledge of ``HTML``, but little programming
experience. The structure of the library has been chosen to expose the features
of the underlying Javascript programming language, and to be extensible using
the same.

**Thank you for checking out lab.js!** If you are new around here, you
might want to go through the :ref:`tutorial` to get started. There are also
plenty of :ref:`examples` if you are searching for code, or looking to extend
an existing experiment. If you are interested in our approach, we have tried
to summarize the :ref:`philosophy` we came up with post-hoc to justify why
we did this in the first place. Of course, you are more than welcome to
:ref:`contribute` if you see room for improvement -- help and suggestions are
very much appreciated!
