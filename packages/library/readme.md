# lab.js

**Building blocks for browser-based behavioral experiments.**

----

**`lab.js` is a tool for constructing browser-based studies** using a graphical builder interface, or through pure JavaScript code. This library is the code-based runtime that underpins all studies built using either method. You'll want to use it if you would like to program your study manually, or if you require the maximum possible flexibility. The [graphical builder](https://labjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/learn/builder/) will get you started more quickly in most other cases.

## Installation

Static builds are available with every [release](https://github.com/FelixHenninger/lab.js/releases), and [mirrored](https://unpkg.com/lab.js) on [unpkg](https://unpkg.com).

If you use a package manager like `npm` or `yarn`, add `lab.js` to your project with one of the following commands:

```
$ npm install lab.js
$ yarn add lab.js # (alternatively)
```

## Basic usage

The idea underlying this little library is that studies are assembled from individual _components_. The simplest example might be the following:

study.js
```
// import the module you want to use
import { html } from 'lab.js'

// Define a component
const hello = new html.Screen({
  content: 'Hello world!'
})

// Run it
hello.run()
```

Include the script in your index.html
```
  <head>
    ...
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="container fullscreen" id="container">
      <main class="content-vertical-center content-horizontal-center" data-labjs-section="main">
          <p>
            <strong>Preparing experiment</strong><br />
            <span class="text-muted">please wait a moment</span>
          </p>
        </div>
          ...
        <script src="study.js"></script>
      </main>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

Each component can [provide information to participants](https://labjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/html.html), as in the above example, or [add structure to the study](https://labjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/flow.html). Besides the content, components [coordinate user events](https://labjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/core.html#options.responses) and [collect data](https://labjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/data.html), providing the central functionality for any browser-based study. Every component can also be extended using [hooks](https://labjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/core.html#event-api) which allow custom code to be added at any point within the study.
