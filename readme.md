**`lab.js` is a tool for constructing browser-based studies** built for (but
not limited to) the social and cognitive sciences. Studies can be assembled
using a graphical builder, or through code. In either case, `lab.js` takes care
of study presentation, response collection and data storage, while providing
the greatest possible flexibility with regard to study design.

###Get started

The [**graphical builder interface**](https://labjs.felixhenninger.com) is the
easiest way to create studies, and the best place to start. The tutorial
will walk you through [building your first study, step by
step](https://labjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/index.html).

If you prefer working directly with code, you can build studies using the
[**JavaScript library**](https://labjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/index.html).
Everything you need is bundled in the *starter kit*, which is [provided with
every release](https://github.com/FelixHenninger/lab.js/releases/latest).
There is also a tutorial to [help you get started](https://labjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/index.html).

If you get stuck or things don't make sense, please don't hesitate to reach out!

###Find help

The easiest and quickest way to find help is to [join our **Slack
channel**](https://slackin-nmbrcrnchrs.herokuapp.com/), where there's someone
around to discuss things and help out most of the time. You're welcome to just
join and say hello!

###Keep up-to-date

If you'd like to keep in the loop regarding the development, please [subscribe
to our **newsletter**](http://eepurl.com/co0K9r) to receive very occasional
updates and release notifications.

do so: This is an open project! We'd be glad to hear from you, to discuss ideas
and approaches, and to get you going. There's an [overview of the code and
intro to the build
process](https://labjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/meta/contribute.html) in the
documentation, but as always, we'd be happy to help.

If you're searching for a place to contribute, please also let us know: There's
always things to do, and we'd be glad to help you find something that fits your

* The **builder**, the graphical interface used to build experiments,
  is provided under the terms of the [GNU Affero General Public
  License](/builder/license).

The studies you build based on the library, and those you create using the
builder, are always your own, and you are free to distribute them as you see
fit. When studies include the core library files, these files alone are governed
