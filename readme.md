**`lab.js` makes it easy to build, run and share studies that help understand the mind.** It allows everyone to construct and construct experiments and surveys within the browser; the graphical builder makes it easy to get started without writing code.

### Get started 🚀

The [**graphical builder interface**](https://lab.js.org/builder) is the
easiest way to create studies, and the best place to start. The tutorial
will walk you through [building your first study, step by
step](https://labjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/learn/builder/).

If you prefer working directly with code, you can build studies using the
[**JavaScript library**](https://lab.js.org/docs/en/latest/reference/).
Everything you need is bundled in the *starter kit*, which is [provided with
every release](https://github.com/FelixHenninger/lab.js/releases/latest).
There is also a tutorial to [help you get started](https://lab.js.org/docs/en/latest/learn/code/).

If you get stuck or things don't make sense, please don't hesitate to reach out!

### Find help ☎️

The easiest and quickest way to find help is to [join our **Support
channel**](https://lab.js.org/resources/support/), where there's someone
around to discuss things and help out most of the time. You're welcome to just
join and say hello, we'd love to have you around!

### Keep up-to-date 📮

If you'd like to keep in the loop regarding the development, please [subscribe
to our **newsletter**](http://eepurl.com/co0K9r) to receive very occasional
updates and release notifications.

### Help improve `lab.js`! ✨☀️

**We would love to have you as part of this project!** There are lots of
different [**ways to contribute**](https://lab.js.org/docs/en/latest/meta/contribute/ways.html),
and we recognize and very warmly welcome all kinds of involvement:

* **Feedback, ideas and suggestions** are always appreciated. If we can make `lab.js` more useful, we'd love to!
* If you've found something that didn't work, felt harder than it should, or figured out a trick, it's likely that others will benefit from your experience. Please [**file an issue**](https://github.com/FelixHenninger/lab.js/issues/new) that describes what's going on, or **contribute a brief recipe** to the documentation.
* We wholeheartedly invite fellow scientists and students to **share your studies**: Chances are that others are trying something very similar — by sharing yours, you'll be giving other researchers a head start. We'll happily help you polish your study if you'd like.
* Of course, **code contributions** are hugely welcome! If you're missing something, we'd love to work with you to extend the project. If you're looking for an area to contribute, [let us know](#find-help), or [check out the issues](https://github.com/FelixHenninger/lab.js/issues) for some ideas — we'd love to support you and help you get started, regardless of your skill level: **We are all learners**.

**Please also let us know if you'd like to join in but are unsure how**, we'd be
thrilled to help you find something that suits your interests and resources.
The [**contributor's guide**](contributing.md) provides further information
about our process; we have some pointers regarding how to [build the project](https://lab.js.org/docs/en/latest/meta/contribute/build.html)
in the documentation.

The students and teaching assistants in the graduate course *Research Methods
in Cognitive Psychology* at the University of Koblenz-Landau inspire the
continued development of this software, have provided countless valuable
insights, and sparked many of the ideas embodied in this project through
questions and discussions.

If you would like to support development as a scientific institution, the
easiest way is to **host a workshop**. We'll gladly show you and your
colleagues how to build experiments using this software, and build your
favorite paradigm together! We are also open to **consulting** if you are
looking for a particular feature — please don't hesitate to get in touch so
that we can discuss things in more detail.
