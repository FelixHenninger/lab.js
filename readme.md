**`lab.js` is a tool for constructing browser-based studies** built for (but
not limited to) the social and cognitive sciences. Studies can be assembled
using a graphical builder, or through code. In either case, `lab.js` takes care
of study presentation, response collection and data storage, while providing
the greatest possible flexibility with regard to study design.

### Get started

The [**graphical builder interface**](https://labjs.felixhenninger.com) is the
easiest way to create studies, and the best place to start. The tutorial
will walk you through [building your first study, step by
step](https://labjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/learn/builder/).

If you prefer working directly with code, you can build studies using the
[**JavaScript library**](https://labjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/).
Everything you need is bundled in the *starter kit*, which is [provided with
every release](https://github.com/FelixHenninger/lab.js/releases/latest).
There is also a tutorial to [help you get started](https://labjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/learn/code/).

If you get stuck or things don't make sense, please don't hesitate to reach out!

### Find help

The easiest and quickest way to find help is to [join our **Slack
channel**](https://slackin-nmbrcrnchrs.herokuapp.com/), where there's someone
around to discuss things and help out most of the time. You're welcome to just
join and say hello!

### Keep up-to-date

If you'd like to keep in the loop regarding the development, please [subscribe
to our **newsletter**](http://eepurl.com/co0K9r) to receive very occasional
updates and release notifications.

### Help improve `lab.js`!

**We would love to have you as part of this project!** We warmly welcome ideas
and suggestions, bug reports and code contributions — please also let us know if
you'd like to join in but are unsure how, we'd be glad to help you find
something that suits your interests and resources. The [**contributor's
guide**](contributing.md) also provides further information.

The students and teaching assistants in the graduate course *Research Methods
in Cognitive Psychology* at the University of Koblenz-Landau inspire the
continued development of this software, have provided countless valuable
insights, and sparked many of the ideas embodied in this project through
questions and discussions.

#### Sponsors and supporters

We are wholeheartedly grateful to our generous sponsors for making possible the
development of this tool:

[FernUniversität in Hagen](https://www.fernuni-hagen.de/psychologie/psychologisches_institut/about_institute/departments/app_lme/) ·
[GESS, University of Mannheim](http://gess.uni-mannheim.de/) ·
[Rational Altruists Mannheim](http://www.ram-ev.de/) ·
[University of Koblenz-Landau](https://www.cognition.uni-landau.de/)

If you would like to support development as a scientific institution, the
easiest way is to **host a workshop**. We'll gladly show you and your
colleagues how to build experiments using this software, and build your
favorite paradigm together! We are also open to **consulting** if you are
looking for a particular feature — please don't hesitate to get in touch so
that we can discuss things in more detail.
