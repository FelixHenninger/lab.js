**`lab.js` makes it easy to build, conduct and share studies in the behavioral and cognitive sciences.** It allows everyone to construct and run experiments and surveys within the browser; the graphical builder makes it easy to get started without writing code.

### Get started 🚀

The [**graphical builder interface**](https://labjs.felixhenninger.com) is the
easiest way to create studies, and the best place to start. The tutorial
will walk you through [building your first study, step by
step](https://labjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/learn/builder/).

If you prefer working directly with code, you can build studies using the
[**JavaScript library**](https://labjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/).
Everything you need is bundled in the *starter kit*, which is [provided with
every release](https://github.com/FelixHenninger/lab.js/releases/latest).
There is also a tutorial to [help you get started](https://labjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/learn/code/).

If you get stuck or things don't make sense, please don't hesitate to reach out!

### Find help ☎️

The easiest and quickest way to find help is to [join our **Slack
channel**](https://slackin-nmbrcrnchrs.herokuapp.com/), where there's someone
around to discuss things and help out most of the time. You're welcome to just
join and say hello, we'd love to have you around!

### Keep up-to-date 📮

If you'd like to keep in the loop regarding the development, please [subscribe
to our **newsletter**](http://eepurl.com/co0K9r) to receive very occasional
updates and release notifications.

### Help improve `lab.js`! ✨☀️

**We would love to have you as part of this project!** There are lots of
different [**ways to contribute**](https://labjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/meta/contribute/ways.html),
and we recognize and very warmly welcome all kinds of involvement:

* **Feedback, ideas and suggestions** are always appreciated. If we can make `lab.js` more useful, we'd love to!
* If you've found something that didn't work, felt harder than it should, or figured out a trick, it's likely that others will benefit from your experience. Please [**file an issue**](https://github.com/FelixHenninger/lab.js/issues/new) that describes what's going on, or **contribute a brief recipe** to the documentation.
* We wholeheartedly invite fellow scientists and students to **share your studies**: Chances are that others are trying something very similar — by sharing yours, you'll be giving other researchers a head start. We'll happily help you polish your study if you'd like.
* Of course, **code contributions** are hugely welcome! If you're missing something, we'd love to work with you to extend the project. If you're looking for an area to contribute, [let us know](#find-help), or [check out the issues](https://github.com/FelixHenninger/lab.js/issues) for some ideas — we'd love to support you and help you get started, regardless of your skill level: **We are all learners**.

**Please also let us know if you'd like to join in but are unsure how**, we'd be
thrilled to help you find something that suits your interests and resources.
The [**contributor's guide**](contributing.md) provides further information
about our process; we have some pointers regarding how to [build the project](https://labjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/meta/contribute/build.html)
in the documentation.

The students and teaching assistants in the graduate course *Research Methods
in Cognitive Psychology* at the University of Koblenz-Landau inspire the
continued development of this software, have provided countless valuable
insights, and sparked many of the ideas embodied in this project through
questions and discussions.

#### Sponsors and supporters 🎩

We are wholeheartedly grateful to our generous sponsors for making possible the
development of this tool:

[FernUniversität in Hagen](https://www.fernuni-hagen.de/psychologie/psychologisches_institut/about_institute/departments/app_lme/) ·
[GESS, University of Mannheim](http://gess.uni-mannheim.de/) ·
[Rational Altruists Mannheim](http://www.ram-ev.de/) ·
[University of Koblenz-Landau](https://www.cognition.uni-landau.de/)

If you would like to support development as a scientific institution, the
easiest way is to **host a workshop**. We'll gladly show you and your
colleagues how to build experiments using this software, and build your
favorite paradigm together! We are also open to **consulting** if you are
looking for a particular feature — please don't hesitate to get in touch so
that we can discuss things in more detail.
