**`lab.js` is a toolkit for constructing browser-based online experiments in
Javascript.** It vastly simplifies the construction of experiments by taking
care of stimulus display and timing, response collection, and data storage. The
library builds on the idea that experiments are constructed from individual
*components*: The stimuli themselves, and sequences and loops that provide
structure to the experiment.

###Get started

Everything you need to get started is contained in the *starter kit*, which
you can download via the [latest release](https://github.com/FelixHenninger/lab.js/releases/latest).
With that in hand, please be invited to take a look at the tutorial, which will
walk you through building an experiment.

If you get stuck or things don't make sense, please don't hesitate to reach out!
